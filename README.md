Chitter Challenge
=================

This is the Makers Academy Week 4 weekend challenge, which gave me the opportunity to practice building web apps using databases. The challenge was to build a small Twitter clone that will allow users to post messages to a public stream.

User stories:
-------

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

```

How to install the program:
------
1. Clone this repo
2. Run 'bundle install'

How to run the program:
------

1. `rackup -p 9292`
2. Visit http://localhost/9292/peeps
3. To post a peep, click on the "Post a Peep" button


Learning objectives covered:
------
1. Building a simple web app with a database
2. Following an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Better understanding of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)
4. How to use tools such as TablePlus when using databases
5. Further practice with Agile and TDD

To improve:
------
I have successfully completed the first three user stories. If I had time I would like to implement the registration feature, and also work on some bonus features such as a user being able to delete a peep, amend a peep and tag a peep.
